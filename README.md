This is a default NextJS app that demonstrates the issue with the `@segment/consent-manager` package when the nextjs configuration option `reactStrictMode` is set to `true`.

We use the default app created via `create-next-app@latest`. We run `npm add @segment/consent-manager` to include the dependency. Next, we change the `page.tsx` file to use the example provided in the `@segment/consent-manager` repo. Finally, we have set the `reactStrictMode` in `next.config.js`.

When attempting to click on the button on the homepage, no content appears. If we clone the [fix](https://github.com/shofman/consent-manager/tree/fix-consent-manager-not-working-with-nextjs) and include it within the package.json `"@segment/consent-manager2": "../consent-manager",` and swap the references in `page.tsx`, we can see that it works as expected.
